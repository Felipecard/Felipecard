### Hi there! üòÅ


My name's Felipe and I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student (üìö), always passionate about technology. My journey started when I came across some Python code in a research project when I was still studying Tourism, where I had my first contact with development. A few years later (2019), I decided to dedicate myself to programming for real, built a good logical base in Python and then found myself in the development of Web applications (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript). Today I keep improving myself, looking for new challenges with React JS.

Would you like to find me?
